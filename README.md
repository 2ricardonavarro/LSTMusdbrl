# LSTMusdbrl

The aim of this study is to investigate the predictability of the B3â€™s Future Dollar price variations and to measure the financial gains of this predictions. The prediction method evaluated was the artificial neural network with short and long-term memory (LSTM), based on intraday data of the period from August 2020 to July 2021. The neural network model considered a set of input variables that influence the dynamics of the Future Dollar price. The forecast horizons tested were 30 seconds and 1 minute ahead. The tested LSTM network was used to classify winning and losing trades in a pre-defined trading strategy. For both forecast horizons, the LSTM network improved the financial profit in 26 months, in a total of 36 months of the validation set. As a benchmark, the results of the LSTM network were compared with other classifiers traditionally considered in machine learning literature. When compared to other alternative models, the trading strategy based on LSTM Neural Network predictions proved to be a potential alternative for market agents who trade dollar futures in the Brazilian derivatives market. The data processing C# code and the LSTM Python code with the inputs data are available for reproduction in: https://github.com/PriceForecast/LSTMusdbrl.
